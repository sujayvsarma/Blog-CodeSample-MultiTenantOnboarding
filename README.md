# Multi-tenant Sample
---

This is the code sample accompanying my blog article series on onboarding an application as a multi-tenant application with Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

You can use the concepts and code in this article on its own. This code in this library has *NO LICENSE*, meaning I own the license to the code but you are allowed to do what you wish with it.

Follow the article series [https://blog.sujayvsarma.com/how-to/multi-tenant-azure-ad-application/register-multi-tenant-app-in-azure-ad/](here).
